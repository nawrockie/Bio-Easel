Bio-Easel

version 0.08
April 2019

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

This module requires the Easel C library, which needs to 
be cloned from GitHub. Before you can do that you will 
need to create a 'src' directory. 
        mkdir src 
        (cd src; git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel.git easel)
        (cd src/easel; git checkout tags/Bio-Easel-0.08; rm -rf .git)
  
  ***The last line of commands will create output stating that you are
     in a 'detached HEAD' state, which sounds bad. You can safely
     ignore this. This is because we've checked out a specific commit
     of the easel git repository. The final part of this command 'rm
     -rf .git' removes all git related files so that src/easel is no
     longer under git control anyway.  Part of the reason we do this
     is as a precaution, so that you don't try to develop easel while
     in this directory. To do that, you'll need to clone it again, and
     you should only do that if you know what you're doing.

Then, to install this module, run the following commands from the 
top level Bio-Easel directory:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
