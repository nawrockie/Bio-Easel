Bio-Easel

version 0.02
July 2016

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

This module requires the Easel C library, which needs to 
be cloned from GitHub. Before you can do that you will 
need to create a 'src' directory. 
        mkdir src

Then, to install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
